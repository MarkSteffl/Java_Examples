# Java_Examples
A few examples of past Java coding exercises 

Most of the files are from practice sessions while training for the MICS programming competition
while I was in college.  The C# folder is added to give more recent examples of my coding practices,
as most of my work was done in C# near the end of college.  These specific C# files are scripts from
a project done in the Unity game engine.
